## 🔨 Usage

Using the NG-ZORRO V5 Experimental View is straightforward. Follow these steps to integrate it into your Angular application:

1. **Update your `angular.json` file:**
   In the `"styles"` array, ensure you import the version 5 styles after the original styles. Add the following lines:

```diff
{
  "styles": [
    "node_modules/ng-zorro-antd/ng-zorro-antd.min.css", // should already exist
    "node_modules/ng-zorro-v5-experimental-view/src/styles/ant-design-v5.css" // new
  ]
}
```
